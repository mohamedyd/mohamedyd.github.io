abstract={Maintaining high data quality is crucial for reliable data analysis and machine learning (ML). However, existing data quality management tools often lack automation, interactivity, and integration with ML workflows. This demonstration paper introduces DataLens, a novel interactive dashboard designed to streamline and automate the data quality management process for tabular data. DataLens integrates a suite of data profiling, error detection, and re- pair tools, including statistical, rule-based, and ML-based methods. It features a user-in-the-loop module for interactive rule validation, data labeling, and custom rule definition, enabling domain experts to guide the cleaning process. Furthermore, DataLens implements an iterative cleaning module that automatically selects optimal cleaning tools based on downstream ML model performance. To ensure reproducibility, DataLens generates DataSheets capturing essential metadata and integrates with MLflow and Delta Lake for experiment tracking and data version control. This demonstration showcases DataLens's capabilities in effectively identifying and correcting data errors, improving data quality for downstream tasks, and promoting reproducibility in data cleaning pipelines.},

abstract={This paper introduces GLLM, an innovative tool that leverages Large Language Models (LLMs) to automatically generate G-code from natural language instructions for Computer Numerical Control (CNC) machining. GLLM addresses the challenges of manual G-code writing by bridging the gap between human-readable task descriptions and machine-executable code. The system incorporates a fine-tuned StarCoder-3B model, enhanced with domain-specific training data and a Retrieval- Augmented Generation (RAG) mechanism. GLLM employs advanced prompting strategies and a novel self-corrective code generation approach to ensure both syntactic and semantic correctness of the generated G-code. The architecture includes robust validation mechanisms, including syntax checks, G-code-specific verifications, and functional correctness evaluations using Hausdorff distance. By combining these techniques, GLLM aims to democratize CNC programming, making it more accessible to users without extensive programming experience while maintaining high accuracy and reliability in G-code generation.},

  abstract={Machine learning's influence is expanding rapidly, now integral to decision-making processes from corporate strategy to the advancements in Industry 4.0. The efficacy of Artificial Intelligence broadly hinges on the caliber of data used during its training phase; optimal performance is tied to exceptional data quality. Data cleaning tools, particularly those that exploit functional dependencies within ontological frameworks or context models, are instrumental in augmenting data quality. Nevertheless, crafting these context models is a demanding task, both in terms of resources and expertise, often necessitating specialized knowledge from domain experts. In light of these challenges, this paper introduces an innovative approach, called LLMClean, for the automated generation of context models, utilizing Large Language Models to analyze and understand various datasets. LLMClean encompasses a sequence of actions, starting with categorizing the dataset, extracting or mapping relevant models, and ultimately synthesizing the context model. To demonstrate its potential, we have developed and tested a prototype that applies our approach to three distinct datasets from the Internet of Things, healthcare, and Industry 4.0 sectors. The results of our evaluation indicate that our automated approach can achieve data cleaning efficacy comparable with that of context models crafted by human experts.},

abstract={In this paper, we present a new method for learned data cleaning. In contrast to existing methods, our method learns to clean data in the latent space. The main idea is that we (1) shape the latent space such that we know the area where clean data resides and (2) learn latent operators trained on error repair (Lopster) which shift erroneous data (e.g., table rows with noise, outliers, or missing values) in their latent representation back to a “clean” region, thus abstracting the complexities of the input domain. When formulating data cleaning as a simple shift operation in latent space, we can repair all types of errors using the same method which makes it more robust than other methods. Importantly, with our method, we can handle errors that are unseen during the training of our error repair model. We do not rely on an external error detection method as seen in the state-of-the-art, instead, we handle both detection and repair within the Lopster framework. In our evaluation, we show that our approach outperforms existing cleaning methods even when trained on only a subset of the errors that occur in the dirty data.},

Our approach mitigates overfitting and ensures robustness in handling data distribution shifts. We evaluate our method on a comprehensive dataset comprising energy consumption records of buildings, as well as two additional datasets to assess the transferability of our approach to other domains, regression, and classification problems.

Nevertheless, these tools suffer from several shortcomings, encompassing the necessity for domain-specific expertise and substantial time requirements. To address these shortcomings, we introduce a novel error detection tool, denoted as SAGED, which leverage meta-learning principles. Specifically, SAGED exploits an ensemble of pre-trained models derived from historical datasets to facilitate error detection in new data with limited labeled instances. The method consists of two key phases: knowledge extraction and error detection. In the knowledge extraction phase, ML models are trained to distinguish erroneous instances within historical datasets, thereby accumulating valuable insights. In the error detection phase, pretrained base models, chosen through rigorous matching, generate a comprehensive feature vector based on predictions, facilitating the role of a meta-classifier in pinpointing errors efficiently. As a proof of concept, we conduct a comparative study of SAGED against ten state-of-the-art error detection tools, employing a set of 14 real-world datasets. The findings reveal the superior performance of SAGED in error detection tasks, with limited user intervention. SAGED’s promising results demonstrate its effectiveness and efficiency in real-world scenarios.},

To combat the lack of understanding of AI-based systems, Explainable AI (XAI) aims to make black-box AI models more transparent and comprehensible for humans. Fortunately, plenty of XAI methods have been introduced to tackle the explainability problem from different perspectives. However, due to the vast search space, it is challenging for ML practitioners and data scientists to start with the development of XAI software and to optimally select the most suitable XAI methods. To tackle this challenge, we introduce XAIR, a novel systematic metareview of the most promising XAI methods and tools. XAIR differentiates itself from existing reviews by aligning its results to the five steps of the software development process, including requirement analysis, design, implementation, evaluation, and deployment. Through this mapping, we aim to create a better understanding of the individual steps of developing XAI software and to foster the creation of real-world AI applications that incorporate explainability.

In essence, building well-performing ML applications requires the provision of high-quality data throughout the entire life-cycle of such applications. Nevertheless, most of the real-world tabular data suffer from different types of discrepancies, such as missing values, outliers, duplicates, pattern violation, and inconsistencies. Such discrepancies typically emerge while collecting, transferring, storing, and/or integrating the data. To deal with these discrepancies, numerous data cleaning methods have been introduced. However, the majority of such methods broadly overlook the requirements imposed by downstream ML models. As a result, the potential of utilizing these data cleaning methods in ML pipelines is predominantly unrevealed. In this work, we introduce a comprehensive benchmark, called REIN, to thoroughly investigate the impact of data cleaning methods on various ML models. Through the benchmark, we provide answers to important research questions, e.g., where and whether data cleaning is a necessary step in ML pipelines. To this end, the benchmark examines 38 simple and advanced error detection and repair methods. To evaluate these methods, we utilized a wide collection of ML models trained on 14 publicly-available datasets covering different domains and encompassing realistic as well as synthetic error profiles.},

abstract={Nowadays, autonomous driving and driver assistance applications are being developed at an accelerated pace. This rapid growth is primarily driven by the potential of such smart applications to significantly improve safety on public roads and offer new possibilities for modern transportation concepts. Such indispensable applications typically require wireless connectivity between the vehicles and their surroundings, i.e. roadside infrastructure and cloud services. Nevertheless, such connectivity to external networks exposes the internal systems of individual vehicles to threats from remotely-launched attacks. In this realm, it is highly crucial to identify any misbehavior of the software components which might occur owing to either these threats or even software/hardware malfunctioning. In this paper, we introduce AutoSec, a host-based anomaly detection algorithm which relies on observing four timing parameters of the executed software components to accurately detect malicious behavior on the operating system level. To this end, AutoSec formulates the task of detecting anomalistic executions as a clustering problem. Specifically, AutoSec devises a hybrid clustering algorithm for grouping a set of collected timing traces resulted from executing the legitimate code. During the runtime, AutoSec simply classifies a certain execution as an anomaly, if its timing parameters are distant enough from the boundaries of the predefined clusters. To show the effectiveness of AutoSec, we collected timing traces from a testbed composed of a set of real and virtual control units communicating over a CAN bus. We show that using our proposed AutoSec, compared to baseline methods, we can identify up to 21% less false positives and 18% less false negatives.},}

abstract={Recently, named data networking (NDN) has been introduced to connect the world of computing devices via naming data instead of their containers. Through this strategic change, NDN brings several new features to network communication, including in-network caching, multipath forwarding, built-in multicast, and data security. Despite these unique features of NDN networking, there exist plenty of opportunities for continuing developments, especially with packet forwarding and caching. In this context, we introduce liteNDN, a novel forwarding and caching strategy for NDN networks. liteNDN comprises a cooperative forwarding strategy through which NDN routers share their knowledge, i.e. data names and interfaces, to optimize their packet forwarding decisions. Subsequently, liteNDN leverages that knowledge to estimate the probability of each downstream path to swiftly retrieve the requested data. Additionally, liteNDN exploits heuristics, such as routing costs and data significance, to make proper decisions about caching normal as well as segmented packets. The proposed approach has been extensively evaluated in terms of the data retrieval latency, network utilization, and the cache hit rate. The results showed that liteNDN, compared to conventional NDN forwarding and caching strategies, achieves much less latency while reducing the unnecessary traffic and caching activities.},

 abstract={Internet of Things (IoT) is expanding at a rapid rate where it allows for virtually endless opportunities and connections to take place. In general, IoT opens the door to a myriad of applications but also to many challenges. One of the major challenges is how to efficiently retrieve the sensory data from “resources-limited” IoT devices. Such devices typically have a restricted energy budget, which broadly hinders their direct connection to the Internet. In this realm, modern mobile devices, e.g. smartphones, tablets, smartwatches, have been harnessed to bridge between the low-power IoT devices and the Internet. However, the current vision which mainly relies on designing siloed gateways, i.e. a separate gateway/App for each IoT device, is certainly impractical, especially with the rapid growth in the number of IoT devices. Furthermore, energy efficiency of the smart mobile devices hosting the IoT gateways has to be thoroughly considered. To tackle these challenges, we introduce GaaS (Gateway as a Service), a cross-platform gateway architecture for opportunistically retrieving sensory data from the low-power IoT sensors. Through Bluetooth low energy radios, GaaS is capable of simultaneously connecting to several nearby IoT sensors. To this end, we devise two distinct priority-based scheduling algorithms, namely the EP-WSM and FEP-AHP schedulers, which rank the detected IoT sensors, before estimating the connection time for each IoT sensor. The intuition behind ranking the IoT sensors is to improve the data retrieval rate from these sensors together with reducing the energy overhead on the mobile devices. Additionally, GaaS encompasses a self-adaptive engine to automatically balance the trade-off between energy efficiency and data retrieval rate through switching between schedulers according to the runtime dynamics. To demonstrate the effectiveness of GaaS, we implemented an IoT testbed to evaluate the energy consumption, the latency, and the data retrieval rate. The results show that using GaaS, compared to siloed gateways, we can identify up to 18% savings in the consumed energy while requiring much less data retrieval time.},

In MapSense, we mainly focus on improving the modeling accuracy through adopting formal grammars which encode design-time knowledge, i.e. structural information about the building. In addition to modeling accuracy, MapSense considers the energy overhead on the mobile devices via developing a probabilistic quality model through which the mobile devices solely upload high-quality point clouds to the crowd-sensing servers. To demonstrate the performance of MapSense, we implemented a crowdsensing Android App to collect 3D point clouds from two different buildings by six volunteers. The results showed that MapSense can accurately infer the various structural objects together with drastically reducing the energy overhead on the mobile devices.},

 abstract={Recently, point clouds have been efficiently utilized for medical imaging, modeling urban environments, and indoor modeling. In this realm, several mobile platforms, such as Google Tango and Apple ARKit, have been released leveraging 3D mapping, augmented reality, etc. In modeling applications, these modern mobile devices opened the door for crowd-sourcing point clouds to distribute the overhead of data collection. However, uploading these large points clouds from resources-constrained mobile devices to the back-end servers consumes excessive energy. Accordingly, participation rates in such crowd-sensing systems can be negatively influenced. To tackle this challenge, this paper introduces our ComNSense approach that dramatically reduces the energy consumption of processing and uploading point clouds. To this end, ComNSense reports only a set of extracted geometrical data to the servers. To optimize the geometry extraction, ComNSense leverages formal grammars which encode design-time knowledge, i.e. structural information. To demonstrate the effectiveness of ComNSense, we performed several experiments of collecting point clouds from two different buildings to extract the walls location, as a case study. We also assess the performance of ComNSense relative to a grammar-free method. The results showed a significant reduction of the energy consumption while achieving a comparable detection accuracy.},

abstract={Recently, crowd-sensing has rapidly been evolved thanks to the technological advancement in personal mobile devices. This emerging technology opens the door for numerous applications to collect sensory data from the crowd. To provide people with a motive for participating in data acquisition, the crowd-sensing systems have to sidestep burdening the resources allocated to the mobile devices, i.e. computing power and energy budget. In this paper, we propose iSense, a novel framework for reducing the energy costs of participating in crowd-sensing. We mainly target the superfluous energy overhead on the mobile devices to sense and report their position information to the back-end servers. To relieve such an overhead, iSense entirely offloads the localization burden to the crowd-sensing servers. In this manner, iSense enables the utilization of advanced localization approaches thanks to the high resources of the crowdsensing servers. To this end, iSense opportunistically exploits the “already-existent” network signaling exchanged frequently between the mobile devices and the WiFi networks or the cellular networks. To collect the localization data, we implement a lightweight data collection algorithm on a set of off-theshelves access points. As a case study, we implement a twostep localization method, including a coarse- and a fine-grained localization. In this regard, compressed sensing is employed to estimate the fine-grained solution. To assess the effectiveness of iSense, we implemented a testbed to evaluate the energy consumption and the localization accuracy with different mobility and usage patterns. The results show that using iSense, compared to some baseline methods, we can identify up to 95% savings in the consumed energy.},

 abstract={Recently, several approaches have been proposed to automatically model indoor environments. Most of such efforts principally rely on the crowd to sense data such as motion traces, images, and WiFi footprints. However, large datasets are usually required to derive precise indoor models which can negatively affect the energy efficiency of the mobile devices participating in the crowd-sensing system. Furthermore, the aforementioned data types are hardly suitable for deriving 3D indoor models. To overcome these challenges, we propose GraMap, a QoS-aware automatic indoor modeling approach through crowd-sensing 3D point clouds. GraMap exploits a recently-developed sensors fusion mechanism, namely Tango technology, to cooperatively collect point clouds from the crowd. Afterward, a set of backend servers extracts the required geometrical information to derive indoor models. For the sake of improving the energy efficiency of the mobile devices, GraMap performs data quality assurance along with 3D data compression. Specifically, we propose a probabilistic quality model—implemented on the mobile devices—to ensure high-quality of the captured point clouds. In this manner, we conserve energy via sidestepping the repetition of sensing queries due to uploading low-quality point clouds. Nevertheless, the resultant indoor models may still suffer from incompleteness and inaccuracies. Therefore, GraMap leverages formal grammars which encode design-time knowledge, i.e. structural information about the building, to enhance the quality of the derived models. To demonstrate the effectiveness of GraMap, we implemented a crowd-sensing Android App to collect point clouds from volunteers. We show that GraMap derives highly-accurate models while reducing the energy costs of pre-processing and reporting the point clouds.},

 abstract={Energy efficiency is an important goal for Wireless Sensor Network (WSN) designers. However, successful implementations of such networks are highly dependent on the enabling technologies, as well as on the provisioning of Quality of Service(QoS) in the network. In this paper, we propose a novel strategy, referred to as the lifetime planning for achieving best-effort QoS. Simultaneously, an adequate lifetime required to complete the assigned task is reached. The core idea is to sidestep lifetime maximization strategies in which sensor nodes continue functioning even after the fulfillment of the required task. In these cases, we could deliberately bound the operational lifetime to the expected task lifetime. As a result, more energy can be spent throughout the entire task lifetime for enhancing the provided service qualities. An analytical QoS model is engineered to validate the QoS’s “conflicts-free” nature of lifetime planning. The proposed strategy is feasible via the design of QoS boundaries at design-time. During run-time, the controllable parameters are modulated by a proactive adaptation mechanism. To demonstrate the effectiveness of our design, we conduct an intensive performance evaluation using an office monitoring scenario in a cluster-tree WSN topology. The scenario has been designed in the Contiki network simulator Cooja using Tmote sky motes. Furthermore, we examine the profit of adopting our strategy relative to fixed heuristics and blind adaptation.},

abstract={Wireless sensor networks have been recognized as promising tools to collect relevant, in-situ data for a wide range of application domains. However, such networks suffer from hard constraints including the allocated resources. Hence, current research endeavors strive to minimize the amount of data that has to be transmitted. This is typically achieved via data fusing or sending some nodes to sleep mode whenever their readings exhibit a high degree of spatio/temporal correlation. Accordingly, the degree of correlation can be considered as a metrics for data filtering. The Dynamic time warping (DTW) algorithm is a "natural" candidate for data fusion and correlation estimation at intermediate sensor nodes via matching the various measured readings. However, the DTW algorithm suffers from the excessive computational overhead which is ill-suited for the "resources-taxed" sensor nodes. This work aims at reducing this burden via refining the implementation procedure of the DTW algorithm. The liteDTW is a novel version of the DTW algorithm with linear operations and fuzzy abstraction. The core idea is to reduce the DTW matrix dimensions via shrinking the input patterns. Several simulations and real experiments have been conducted to validate that the liteDTW algorithm excels over the naive one in terms of accuracy, time and space overhead. Moreover, the Cooja simulator of the Contiki OS has been utilized to assess the energy profit of adopting the liteDTW algorithm for data fusion.},

  abstract={Several 'energy-hungry' sensors such as gas detectors, radar, and cameras have excessive energy dissipation. Virtual sensing is a technique which 'breaks the downward spiral' between energy expenditure and events-miss probabilities. The idea is to deactivate main sensors and utilize a set of energy-friendly HW & SW components instead. However, reliability of such systems composed of virtual and real sensors should be as high as possible. In this article, a novel approach is proposed to improve the virtual sensing reliability. An ontology on sensor-environment relationships is utilized to automatically generate rules before deployment to switch between real and virtual sensors. We illustrate the general approach by a case study: we show how reliable virtual sensing reduces the energy consumption and event-miss probabilities of object tracking applications. Seismic sensors and a dynamic time-warping algorithm shape the virtual object tracking sensor. We validate the precision of such virtual sensors over several experiments. A series of experiments with a network of TelosB sensor nodes show that virtual sensors have much less energy consumption than a Doppler μ-radar (main) sensor. Finally, we evaluate event-miss probabilities and lifetime extension by using the WSNet simulator.},

FuzzyCAT adapts the transform parameters in accordance with the signal curvature, which could be inferred from the signal derivatives, to accomplish the optimal balance between compression ratio and precision. Generally, FuzzyCAT provides the users/apps with full control to prioritize either compression ratio or precision according to the significance.

Moreover, a full appraisal depicts the FuzzyCAT eclipses over the LTC at compression ratios above 75.

  abstract={The crux behind this work is to extend the lifetime expectancy of wireless sensor networks (WSNs). In particular, we target exploiting the trade-off between reducing certain quality-of-service (QoS) measures to a degree still tolerable by the application (such as, for example, precision and latency) and maximizing the application's lifetime. For satisfying these objectives, the following sequential steps are addressed. At the outset, an elaborated survey is sketched to aggregate the diverse endeavours in the same context. This survey paves the way for identifying the weak points to be tackled. Basically, we aim at attacking the non-optimal configurations in the hardware, software and network operations that raise the energy consumption. For instance, data compression could alleviate the burden of superfluous transmissions via breaking the downward spiral between compression ratios and precision. For the sensing board, adopting the concept of virtual sensing would minimize duty cycles of the "energy-hungry" sensors. For the radio communication, less energy could be dissipated whenever slashing the operating frequency is viable. Two approaches here can be addressed thorough a careful design of the so-called undersampling receivers, and deliberately activating a subconscious mode midst idle times. From the network scope, current MAC protocols are still non-optimal, hence we reckon a combination of CDMA and RF harvester-based waking up receivers could be an excellent candidate for freely accessing the medium whenever entailed. These proposed techniques are evaluated on a suite of WSN sample applications.},

abstract={In order to extend the operational span of wireless sensor networks, we propose to trade energy consumption for average response time by extending the deactivation periods of sensors with a particularly high energy consumption. To compensate for the temporal inavailability of these sensors, alternative, low-power hybrid sensors generate estimates on the probabilities of the occurrence of interesting events, waking up the corresponding main sensor when detection probability justiﬁes it. We demonstrate the principle on a case study of gas detection and analyze its efﬁciency formally using probabilistic model checking, which is able to compute probabilistic quantiﬁed properties pertaining to energy consumption, lifetime expectancy, and response time. The preliminary results conﬁrm signiﬁcant savings in energy consumption while retaining an acceptable average response time.},

abstract={Wireless sensor networks are superior to wired sensing systems from the economical side provided that the latter require a separate twisted shielded-pair wire connection. Thus, implementation costs for the latter are high. However, wireless sensors have to function for an extensive period of time in order to achieve cost minimization and to successfully complete their particular mission. Therefore, conserving the allocated energy is very important and represents a major dilemma which stands against the wide-spreading of this technology. In this paper, a novel local adaptive data compression based on Fuzzy transform is proposed to minimize the bandwidth, the memory space, and the energy consumed in radio communication. An evaluation of the compression technique is provided. During this evaluation, the proposed technique is examined using real temperature data. The results have shown that the proposed technique can highly reduce the overall power consumption by up to 90 percent. Moreover, a modiﬁcation of the proposed technique is presented which improves the accuracy of the recovered signal even with high compression ratios.},

However, the limited energy source is the dominant factor where energy starvation occurs due to the large number of messages that need to be transferred through the network. In this paper, we propose new protocols to save the nodes energy as well as prolonging the overall network lifetime. Not like other protocols proposed in the literature, our protocols consider the accuracy/ reliability of the reported data to the sink node. Our first approach considers different types of wireless sensor networks including single and multimodal wireless sensor networks. Our second protocol utilizes the concept of distributed fuzzy logic agents for energy saving in wireless sensor network. Our approaches are extensively tested using simulation as well as real data captured from MIT WSN laboratory. In addition, the paper introduces a WSN prototype based on our data saving approaches. Our conclusion reveals promising results.},

abstract={Wireless Sensor Networks have been used in many applications including critical applications such as battle field and health care application. It is also used in many other important applications such as in agriculture. However, such applications require special sensor treatment. Sensors need to be deployed in harsh environment and need to stay alive for long time that could be years not days. In this paper, we propose to utilize wireless sensor networks for greenhouse monitoring against the plant diseases. A multimodal wireless sensor network is used for such purpose. Two different approaches are also proposed for saving the WSN energy including two of the prediction techniques and fuzzy logic controller. In addition, we implemented these approaches in a greenhouse application for plant disease detection. Extensive experiments are conducted to test the performance of the proposed agents.},

  abstract={Intelligent environments, in general, represent the future evolutionary development step for the real world environment. However, to achieve their aims, an intelligent system is required to collect data from the surrounding environment. Wireless Sensor Networks (WSN) is one of the technologies that extensively used to collect such data. It has been used in many applications such as surveillance, machine failure diagnosis, weather forecast, intelligent environments, intelligent campuses and chemical/biological detection. Nonetheless, their nodes suffer from energy starvation due to the large number of messages need to be transferred through the network. The purpose of this paper is to investigate new approaches for data reduction in single and multimodal WSN. The proposed approaches are based exponential smoothing predictors . At the same time, we believe that such approaches will enhance the reliability of the sensed data. Through large number of experiments, we test our approach through real data as well as through simulation.},

  abstract={Indoor positioning has grasped great attention in recent years. A number of efforts have been exerted to achieve high positioning accuracy. However, there exists no technology that proves its efficacy in various situations. In this paper, we propose a novel positioning method based on fusing trilateration and dead reckoning. We employ Kalman filtering as a position fusion algorithm. Moreover, we adopt an Android device with Bluetooth Low Energy modules as the communication platform to avoid excessive energy consumption and to improve the stability of the received signal strength. To further improve the positioning accuracy, we take the environmental context information into account while generating the position fixes. Extensive experiments in a testbed are conducted to examine the performance of three approaches: trilateration, dead reckoning and the fusion method. Additionally, the influence of the knowledge of the environmental context is also examined. Finally, our proposed fusion method outperforms both trilateration and dead reckoning in terms of accuracy: experimental results show that the Kalman-based fusion, for our settings, achieves a positioning accuracy of less than one meter.},

  abstract={Successful exploitation of the Wireless Sensor networks (WSNs) is intuitively dependent on the enabling technologies as well as on the provision of the application-relevant Quality of Service (QoS) metrics. Current research efforts mostly focus on maximizing the network lifetime without considering the predefined task time. In this article, we firstly provide a survey and a classification of the current state of QoS control methods in WSNs. Subsequently, we propose a novel QoS control method, referred to as lifetime planning. Based on the design-time knowledge, the lifetime planning provides users/applications with best-effort QoS while meeting the time span, required to complete the assigned task. To this end, an “upper ” and a “lower ” QoS boundaries have to be defined for every QoS metric at the design time. During the run time, a self-adaptation framework confines the QoS metrics between their boundaries. Analytically, the lifetime planning outperforms other fixed heuristics and blind adaptation methods. As another proof of concept, we consider an office monitoring scenario with a cluster-tree WSN topology for performance evaluation. The scenario has been designed in the Contiki-OS network simulator, Cooja, using Tmote sky motes. Moreover, a novel QoS model has been engineered to determine the QoS boundaries. Simulation results show that lifetime planning tremendously improves the provided QoS while meeting the task lifetime.},

  abstract={Energy saving is often achieved via “squeezing” other application-sensitive Quality of Service (QoS) parameters such as delay and throughput. Accordingly, energy-saving methods must consider those QoS parameters. In this paper, we survey the most recent work on energy efficiency in WSNs and we discuss the impacts of these methods on the QoS provided. Moreover, we propose a novel divide-and-conquer procedure to deal with the trade-off between energy consumption and other QoS parameters. The idea is to tackle a certain source of energy consumption to minimize the drawn energy. Subsequently, this energy-saving method is refined to consider other service qualities. To support the correctness of our claim, three energy-saving methods, taking the QoS issues into consideration, are given as examples. The first method exploits a so-called Fuzzy transform for shrinking the wireless traffic with highly precise lossy data compression. In the second method, the sensing module is targeted by employing reliable virtual sensors. Such sensors compensate the unavailability of main energy-hungry sensors during sleep periods. The third method exploits a self-adaptive mechanism to improve the QoS parameters via deliberately reducing the lifetime below the maximum time and exploiting design-time knowledge.},

  abstract={The crux behind this work is to break the "downward spiral" between reducing certain quality-of-service (QoS) measures and extending the wireless sensor network's (WSN) lifetime. For the sake of identifying research challenges and possible gaps, we conduct a comprehensive survey of the state-of-the-art. The reported methods have been classified into node-oriented methods, data-oriented methods, and network-oriented methods. Afterward, the thesis introduces an energy-centric strategy to manipulate the energy-QoS relationship in the light of the relevant context information. It is a design procedure in which the saved energy is dynamically adjusted according to changes in the application and environmental conditions. These adjustments provide the required energy to enhance the service qualities. Due to diversity of WSN applications, we introduce three different methods, based on the energy-centric strategy, namely Fuzzy transform-based data compression, reliable virtual sensing, and lifetime planning.},
